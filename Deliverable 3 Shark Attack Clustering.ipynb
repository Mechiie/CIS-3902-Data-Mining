    "### 1. Understanding the K Means Clustering Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The $K$-means algorithm divides a set of $N$ samples $X$ into $K$ disjoint clusters $C$, each described by the mean $\\mu_j$ of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the **cluster “centroids”**; note that they are not, in general, points from $X$, although they live in the same space. The K-means algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimise the inertia, or within-cluster sum of squared criterion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\min_{\\mu_j \\in C}(||x_j - \\mu_i||^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the algorithm works\n",
    "\n",
    "The Κ-means clustering algorithm uses iterative refinement to produce a final result. The algorithm inputs are the number of clusters $Κ$ and the data set. The data set is a collection of features for each data point. The algorithms starts with initial estimates for the $Κ$ centroids, which can either be randomly generated or randomly selected from the data set. The algorithm then iterates between two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data assigment step**: Each centroid defines one of the clusters. In this step, each data point is assigned to its nearest centroid, based on the squared Euclidean distance. More formally, if $c_i$ is the collection of centroids in set $C$, then each data point $x$ is assigned to a cluster based on\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underset{c_i \\in C}{\\arg\\min} \\; dist(c_i,x)^2$$\n",
    "where dist( · ) is the standard ($L_2$) Euclidean distance. Let the set of data point assignments for each ith cluster centroid be $S_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Centroid update step**: In this step, the centroids are recomputed. This is done by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that centroid's cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_i=\\frac{1}{|S_i|}\\sum_{x_i \\in S_i x_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm iterates between steps one and two until a stopping criteria is met (i.e., no data points change clusters, the sum of the distances is minimized, or some maximum number of iterations is reached).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Convergence and random initialization **\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a result. The result may be a local optimum (i.e. not necessarily the best possible outcome), meaning that assessing more than one run of the algorithm with randomized starting centroids may give a better outcome.\n",
