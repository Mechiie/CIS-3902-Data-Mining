# Data-Mining
This site provides resources for an introductory course in Data Mining.  Students need an introductory background in Python and Statistics in order to be successful in the class.  For students that need a review of either Python or Statistics, please use the resources provided in "Preparation for Class: A Review of Python and Statistics" or use resources of your choosing.

### Introducing Association Rules for Machine Learning

#### Apriori Algorithm and Association Rule Mining
<p>Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.</p>

<p>Analytics Vidhya has an excellent introduction to Association Rule Mining in Python: </p>

<p>Here is a good video explaining the Apriori Algorithm and Frequent Item Sets for Association Rule Mining:</p>

### A Gentle Introduction to Bayes Theorem for Machine Learning
#### Bayes Theorem
<p>Classification is a predictive modeling problem that involves assigning a label to a given new data sample input. For our case study, we want to know if our flight will be late or not based on what we know at the time we can make a decision to cancel</p>

<p>Analytics Vidhya has an excellent introduction to Bayes and it does not avoid the statistics behind the theorem.  As data scientists, we need to know the statistics behind our models but there is no reason to make it overly complicated!  I think you will like this article on Analytics Vidhya:</p>

<p>Here is a good video explaining Naive Bayes and the Bayes Theorem:</p>
