### Introducing Association Rules for Machine Learning

#### Apriori Algorithm and Association Rule Mining
<p>Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.</p>

<p>Analytics Vidhya has an excellent introduction to Association Rule Mining in Python: </p>
<a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/association-analysis-in-python-2b955d0180c">Association Analysis in Python</a><p></p>
<p>Here is a good video explaining the Apriori Algorithm and Frequent Item Sets for Association Rule Mining:</p>

#### Python Example in Google Colab

<p>Let's check out an example in code.</p>

### A Gentle Introduction to Bayes Theorem for Machine Learning
#### Bayes Theorem
<p>Classification is a predictive modeling problem that involves assigning a label to a given new data sample input. For our case study, we want to know if our flight will be late or not based on what we know at the time we can make a decision to cancel</p>

<p>Analytics Vidhya has an excellent introduction to Bayes and it does not avoid the statistics behind the theorem.  As data scientists, we need to know the statistics behind our models but there is no reason to make it overly complicated!  I think you will like this article on Analytics Vidhya:</p>

<p>Here is a good video explaining Naive Bayes and the Bayes Theorem:</p>
